# Project Status

## Current Phase

**Core agent runtime and tooling implemented. All 170 tests pass locally and in CI on all three platforms.** Lot dependency at rev `0729510`. CI fully green: Windows (170 pass), Linux (170 pass), macOS (170 pass).

## What Is Implemented

- **Agent runtime** (`agent.rs`) — `Agent` struct managing single sessions with configurable grants and timeout. Tool loop runs up to 50 rounds, dispatching to built-in or custom handlers via `ToolHandler` trait. Structured vs. tool-loop routing based on `ToolGrant::NU`. Per-session timeout with model resume cancellation on expiry.
- **Built-in tools** (6 total, `tools.rs`) — `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep` (all execute as nu custom commands: `reel read`, `reel write`, etc.), `NuShell` (direct evaluation). Read-only tools gated on `ToolGrant::NU`; write tools gated on `ToolGrant::WRITE | ToolGrant::NU`.
- **NuShell sandbox** (`nu_session.rs`) — `NuSession` managing a persistent `nu --mcp` process (JSON-RPC 2.0). Per-session temp directory under `<project_root>/.reel/tmp/`. Sandbox policy via `lot` (Windows AppContainer, Linux user/mount/pid namespaces, macOS Seatbelt). Grant-based process respawn if grants or project root change between calls.
- **CLI binary** (`reel-cli`) — `reel run` (execute agent query with YAML config, stdin, dry-run) and `reel setup` (Windows AppContainer ACL prerequisites). Two-pass YAML config parsing: extract reel `grant` field, pass remainder to flick.
- **Build infrastructure** (`build.rs`) — Downloads prebuilt NuShell 0.111.0 and ripgrep 14.1.1 binaries for target platform, verifies SHA-256, caches in `target/nu-cache/`. Generates `reel_config.nu` and `reel_env.nu` for nu custom commands.
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions: fmt, clippy, test, build on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows. Rust 1.93.1 toolchain. Dependencies use pinned git revs (lot, flick). Linux CI uses dynamic cgroup delegation (discovers runner's actual cgroup, enables controllers hierarchically, creates sibling cgroup).
- **Test counts** — 170 tests total, all pass locally.

## What Is NOT Implemented

These are known gaps with no corresponding code:

- **Network control** — Sandbox always allows network. Should be gated by grant or policy (issue #22).
- **Proper error types** — `ToolGrant::from_names` returns `Result<_, String>`. Should use typed errors (issue #30).
- **lot re-export** — `reel-cli` depends on `lot` directly for AppContainer checks. Should be re-exported via `reel::sandbox` (issue #19).
- **Config API mutations** — Flick's `RequestConfig` cannot be mutated post-parse; reel reconstructs via serialization workaround (issue #27).
- **ToolHandler consumer** — Trait exists but no real consumer yet. Design assumes epic's Research Service as first consumer.

## Design Choices (intentional constraints)

### NuShell as execution substrate

All 6 built-in tools execute through a shared NuShell session (custom commands or direct evaluation). Enables state persistence (cwd, variables, env) across tool calls within a session.

### Grant-based tool availability

Bitflags (`WRITE`, `NU`) determine tool list and sandbox policy. Binary decision — no per-tool grants.

### Tool loop over streaming

Request-dispatch-response cycles up to 50 rounds. No streaming of partial model responses.

### Eager NuShell spawn

Process started at session creation (if NU granted), not on first use. Avoids startup cost during tool calls.

### Dual-crate architecture

Library (`reel`) + thin CLI (`reel-cli`). Follows flick's pattern for testability and reusability.

## CI Status

| Job | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Format | pass | |
| Clippy (all 3) | pass | |
| Build (all 3) | pass | |
| Test (Windows) | pass | 170 pass |
| Test (Linux) | pass | 170 pass |
| Test (macOS) | pass | 170 pass |

## Work Candidates

### Re-export lot's sandbox prerequisite APIs (issue #19)

Lot grants traverse ACEs on user-owned ancestor directories automatically at spawn time. System directories (e.g., `C:\Users`) still require a one-time elevated setup via `grant_appcontainer_prerequisites`. Reel does not re-export these APIs, so library consumers cannot implement their own elevated setup command without a direct lot dependency. Add a `reel::sandbox` module re-exporting the prerequisite APIs, `is_elevated()`, and the `PrerequisitesNotMet` error variant. Update `reel-cli` to use the re-exports.
